Abstract

   CoRE defines a mechanism for resource discovery based on Web linking.
   Many applications also need a simple form of discovery for the
   servers carrying these resources.  This specification shows a simple
   way to extend the link-based resource discovery into a basic form of
   server discovery.

   The current version -01 of this document continues an initial draft
   that is intended to spark discussion.

1.  Introduction

   CoRE defines a mechanism for resource discovery based on Web linking
   [RFC5988] [I-D.ietf-core-link-format].  Many applications also need a
   simple form of discovery for the servers carrying these resources.

   More sophisticated CoRE server discovery mechanisms have been
   proposed [I-D.brandt-coap-subnet-discovery].  The present
   specification is not intended as a competing protocol but shows a
   very simple way to extend the link-based resource discovery into a
   basic form of server discovery.  It is an open question whether
   different applications need different discovery solutions or whether
   there can be a "scalable" solution that covers both simple and
   complex scenarios.

   One important requirement for a CoRE server discovery mechanism is
   that it does not assume a functional IP multicast scheme.  This is
   motivated both by the requirement to enable sleeping nodes to
   participate in the protocols as well as by limitations of current
   constrained network routing protocols.

   The protocol as designed here has been prototyped in the SAHARA
   project at TZI in just a few lines of code.  The current version -01
   of this document is intended to spark discussion.  Not all aspects of
   the protocol as specified are part of the current prototype.  We
   expect to update the specification both based on WG feedback and as
   we gain experience with the prototype.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.  (See
   [RFC2119].)

   The term "byte" is used in its now customary sense as a synonym for
   "octet".

   The terminology from [I-D.ietf-core-coap] applies.

   In addition:

   CoAP Server Discovery:  This protocol.

   CoAP Server Discovery Server (CSDS):  A server for this protocol,
      which interacts with other CoAP servers, collects resource
      discovery information from them and integrates it into larger
      resource discovery information sets.

   Candidate CSDS:  An IP address that might or might not be useful for
      conversion to a CSDS URI.

2.  Discovery Servers

   This specification defines a simple form of server discovery that
   makes use of CoAP Server Discovery Servers (CSDS), which are
   addressed simply using the CoAP protocol [I-D.ietf-core-coap].

   The assumption is that there is a way to find one or more CSDSs (see
   Section 4 for a number of such ways).  New CoAP servers that want to
   provide discoverable services can make themselves known at the CSDSs.
   CoAP clients can ask the CSDSs for a resource directory in the usual
   way, which will include both information about the discovery server's
   own resources and information about other servers that made
   themselves known to the discovery servers.

3.  CoAP Server Discovery

   Simple CoAP Server Discovery makes use of a simple mapping from a
   server's IP address to a default discovery URI: The default discovery
   URI is created from the "coap:" scheme, the server IP address, the
   CoAP default port [I-D.ietf-core-coap], and the absolute path
   "/.well-known/core" [I-D.ietf-core-link-format].

   A CoAP server that wants to make itself discoverable occasionally
   sends a POST request to the default discovery URI of any Candidate
   CSDS that it finds.

   The body of the POST request is either

   o  empty, in which case the CoAP Server Discovery Server is
      encouraged by this POST request to perform GET requests at the
      requesting server's default discovery URI.

   or

   o  a link-format document, which indicates the specific services that
      the requesting server wants to make known to the CSDS.

   The CSDS integrates the information it received this way into its
   resource directory.  It MAY make the information available to further
   CSDSs, if it can ensure that a loop does not form.  The protocol used
   between CSDSs to ensure loop-free operation is outside the scope of
   this document.

4.  Finding a Candidate CoAP Server Discovery Server

   CoAP servers that want to contact a CSDS can obtain candidate IP
   addresses for such servers (Candidate CSDS) in a number of ways.

   In a 6LoWPAN, good candidates can be taken from:

   o  specific static configuration (e.g., anycast addresses), if any,

   o  the ABRO option of 6LoWPAN-ND [I-D.ietf-6lowpan-nd],

   o  other ND options that happen to point to servers (such as RDNSS),

   o  DHCPv6 options that might be defined later.

   In networks with more inexpensive use of multicast, the Candidate
   CSDS may be a well-known multicast address, i.e.  CSDS are found by
   simply sending POST requests to that well-known multicast address
   (details TBD).

   As some of these sources are just (more or less educated) guesses,
   CoAP servers MUST make use of any error messages to very strictly
   rate-limit requests to Candidate CSDSs that don't work out.  E.g., an
   ICMP Destination Unreachable message (and, in particular, the port
   unreachable code for this message) may indicate the lack of a CoAP
   server on the candidate host, or a CoAP error response code such as
   4.05 "Method Not Allowed" may indicate unwillingness of a CoAP server
   to act as a CSDS.

6.  Security Considerations

   (None so far; this section will certainly grow as additional security
   considerations beyond those listed in the base specifications become
   known.)

7.  Acknowledgements

   The concept for this document was inspired by Zach Shelby et al.'s
   CoAP discovery node that was available in various CoAP interop
   events.  The current implementation was performed by the students of
   the SAHARA project, including Bengt Kohrt, Julian Kornberger, Henning
   Mueller, and Christian Thedieck.  Philip Nguyen read an early draft
   of this document (but all errors are mine).  Anders Brandt's draft
   [I-D.brandt-coap-subnet-discovery] is a fine piece of work and
   certainly motivated me to finally write this up.
